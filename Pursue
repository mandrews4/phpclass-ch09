P3 Rewrite customize.php so that the script also applies the user’s
   preferences. Hint: You need to take into account the fact that the
   cookies aren’t available immediately after they’ve been set. Instead,
   you would write the CSS code using the $_GET values after the form has
   been submitted, the $_COOKIE values upon first arriving at the page
   (if the cookies exist), and the default values otherwise.

P4 Make the form in customize.php sticky, so that it reflects the user’s
   current choices.

P5 Rewrite welcome.php so that the print statement that greets the user by
   email address uses double quotation marks.

P6 For an added challenge, rewrite welcome.php so that the print statement
   that indicates how long the user has been logged in also uses double
   quotation marks. Hint: You’ll need to use a variable.

P7 Rewrite the last three scripts so that the session uses a custom name.
